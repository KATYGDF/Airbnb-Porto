I love to travel around the world for studies or for leisure. For me to travel/discover new landscapes and new cultures are one of the most important things in life. As I´m used to be in different parts of the world, I appreciate a fantastic place to stay as much as you do! 

I decided to rent my fabulous Beachfront apartment because I think it has luxury conditions for visitors and I like to meet people from other countries. My renters are always delighted with the property and I enjoy seeing their faces as they come into the apartment and see the high standards in quality & style for their holiday. 

I love the place I live in, because it is calm, unbeatable, just by the seaside and for its accessibility to Oporto / Porto. Porto is close to it too (about 30 minutes away by bus from Porto and just 1 minute walk to bus stop). 

I love to arrive home after a long day's work in Porto / Oporto and in the minute I set foot in the entrance hall having Beach and Ocean views. The facilities on the site and the local facilities are more than you can expect with plenty to see, eat and drink. I love it: play a party of squash, swimming, walk on the beach, cycling, go to the beach bars...

It's important to me that renters can relax and enjoy the luxurious comforts of this Beachfront Penthouse whilst sampling the delights of all that Oporto / Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia has to offer. I am very happy to help in anyway, either before, or when you arrive. Just let me know what I can do to make your trip a good one!

Daí que tenha viajado por todo o mundo em trabalho. Daí também o facto de falar 4 idiomas, o que, cumulativamente com o meu gosto pelas ciências humanas e o relacionamento interpessoal, facilita imenso esta minha nova actividade de recepção e acompanhamento de turistas estrangeiros. Após a formação liceal secundária clássica, feita em Portugal, vivi 5 anos em França (Haute-Savoie e Paris), onde fiz estudos superiores e licenciatura.
A família, o trabalho e os princípios éticos e da moral cristã, são as bases de orientação da minha vida. 
Gosto de ler sobre actualização tecnológica e economia e investigar na net sobre saúde. 
Como ""hobbies"" tenho a paixão pelo desporto automóvel, tendo sido piloto amador nos anos 60 e 70. Participei em vários campeonatos nacionais de rallies e de velocidade, e em 1974 participei no rally de Portugal a contar para o campeonato do mundo (sonho realizado).
Ao longo da minha juventude  pratiquei vários outros desportos: atletismo, natação, andebol, hóquei em patins e ténis (que continuo a jogar hoje).
Prefiro indiscutivelmente a boa cozinha portuguesa, a qualquer outra.

Welcome to our self-catered apartments!
 
Located on the historical center of Oporto, in the heart of a UNESCO World Heritage Center, you'll find a building that belongs to our family for four generations.
 
After my mother (Lu'is grandmother) passed away in 2010 I inherited this building and found a really degraded space with a lot of structural problems and fierce tenants.
 
Having one apartment vacant me and my sons decided to refurbish the entire apartment and prepare it with all the needed amenities for a modern and cozy experience.
 
And we decided to rent it for tourists.
 
The first of our apartments came to daylight in May 2012. Our yellow apartment.
 
The experience was so overwhelming with massive bookings and great reviews that we decided to ""tackle"" the rest of the building.
 
And so we did.
 
In October 2012 the building went to major refurbishment works with all the structural, electricity, plumbing and communications being changed.
 
We repaired all the commons spaces, painted all the walls and ceilings, changed the windows, repaired and changed the floors, changed all the bathrooms and kitchens while maintaining at the same time all the qualities that give this building it’s finesse.
 
There wasn't a single square inch that we didn't touch!
  
The rest of the apartments came to the market in June 2013 and the bookings went sky high!
 
Right now we have 9 apartments: Blue (6 pax), Yellow (4 pax), Green (2 pax), Pink (2), Brown (2), Orange (2), White (2) , Grey (2) and Red (2)

Again all the critics are excellent with major emphasis on the quality of the apartments and the warm welcomes that both I and my son Luís provide.
 
This is a family business made with love and with respect for the guests that come here.
 
We want you to feel at home in a foreign place and we like to consider you as more than guests.
 
You are our friends that come to visit our beautiful city.
 
Be prepared to a personalized check in, with our mostly enjoyed briefing on sightseeing, Oporto History and local tips!
 
So, enjoy our apartments!

Welcome to our self-catered apartments!
 
Located on the historical center of Oporto, in the heart of a UNESCO World Heritage Center, you'll find a building that belongs to our family for four generations.
 
After my mother (Lu'is grandmother) passed away in 2010 I inherited this building and found a really degraded space with a lot of structural problems and fierce tenants.
 
Having one apartment vacant me and my sons decided to refurbish the entire apartment and prepare it with all the needed amenities for a modern and cozy experience.
 
And we decided to rent it for tourists.
 
The first of our apartments came to daylight in May 2012. Our yellow apartment.
 
The experience was so overwhelming with massive bookings and great reviews that we decided to ""tackle"" the rest of the building.
 
And so we did.
 
In October 2012 the building went to major refurbishment works with all the structural, electricity, plumbing and communications being changed.
 
We repaired all the commons spaces, painted all the walls and ceilings, changed the windows, repaired and changed the floors, changed all the bathrooms and kitchens while maintaining at the same time all the qualities that give this building it’s finesse.
 
There wasn't a single square inch that we didn't touch!
  
The rest of the apartments came to the market in June 2013 and the bookings went sky high!
 
Right now we have 9 apartments: Blue (6 pax), Yellow (4 pax), Green (2 pax), Pink (2), Brown (2), Orange (2), White (2) , Grey (2) and Red (2)

Again all the critics are excellent with major emphasis on the quality of the apartments and the warm welcomes that both I and my son Luís provide.
 
This is a family business made with love and with respect for the guests that come here.
 
We want you to feel at home in a foreign place and we like to consider you as more than guests.
 
You are our friends that come to visit our beautiful city.
 
Be prepared to a personalized check in, with our mostly enjoyed briefing on sightseeing, Oporto History and local tips!
 
So, enjoy our apartments!

Welcome to our self-catered apartments!
 
Located on the historical center of Oporto, in the heart of a UNESCO World Heritage Center, you'll find a building that belongs to our family for four generations.
 
After my mother (Lu'is grandmother) passed away in 2010 I inherited this building and found a really degraded space with a lot of structural problems and fierce tenants.
 
Having one apartment vacant me and my sons decided to refurbish the entire apartment and prepare it with all the needed amenities for a modern and cozy experience.
 
And we decided to rent it for tourists.
 
The first of our apartments came to daylight in May 2012. Our yellow apartment.
 
The experience was so overwhelming with massive bookings and great reviews that we decided to ""tackle"" the rest of the building.
 
And so we did.
 
In October 2012 the building went to major refurbishment works with all the structural, electricity, plumbing and communications being changed.
 
We repaired all the commons spaces, painted all the walls and ceilings, changed the windows, repaired and changed the floors, changed all the bathrooms and kitchens while maintaining at the same time all the qualities that give this building it’s finesse.
 
There wasn't a single square inch that we didn't touch!
  
The rest of the apartments came to the market in June 2013 and the bookings went sky high!
 
Right now we have 9 apartments: Blue (6 pax), Yellow (4 pax), Green (2 pax), Pink (2), Brown (2), Orange (2), White (2) , Grey (2) and Red (2)

Again all the critics are excellent with major emphasis on the quality of the apartments and the warm welcomes that both I and my son Luís provide.
 
This is a family business made with love and with respect for the guests that come here.
 
We want you to feel at home in a foreign place and we like to consider you as more than guests.
 
You are our friends that come to visit our beautiful city.
 
Be prepared to a personalized check in, with our mostly enjoyed briefing on sightseeing, Oporto History and local tips!
 
So, enjoy our apartments!

Welcome to our self-catered apartments!
 
Located on the historical center of Oporto, in the heart of a UNESCO World Heritage Center, you'll find a building that belongs to our family for four generations.
 
After my mother (Lu'is grandmother) passed away in 2010 I inherited this building and found a really degraded space with a lot of structural problems and fierce tenants.
 
Having one apartment vacant me and my sons decided to refurbish the entire apartment and prepare it with all the needed amenities for a modern and cozy experience.
 
And we decided to rent it for tourists.
 
The first of our apartments came to daylight in May 2012. Our yellow apartment.
 
The experience was so overwhelming with massive bookings and great reviews that we decided to ""tackle"" the rest of the building.
 
And so we did.
 
In October 2012 the building went to major refurbishment works with all the structural, electricity, plumbing and communications being changed.
 
We repaired all the commons spaces, painted all the walls and ceilings, changed the windows, repaired and changed the floors, changed all the bathrooms and kitchens while maintaining at the same time all the qualities that give this building it’s finesse.
 
There wasn't a single square inch that we didn't touch!
  
The rest of the apartments came to the market in June 2013 and the bookings went sky high!
 
Right now we have 9 apartments: Blue (6 pax), Yellow (4 pax), Green (2 pax), Pink (2), Brown (2), Orange (2), White (2) , Grey (2) and Red (2)

Again all the critics are excellent with major emphasis on the quality of the apartments and the warm welcomes that both I and my son Luís provide.
 
This is a family business made with love and with respect for the guests that come here.
 
We want you to feel at home in a foreign place and we like to consider you as more than guests.
 
You are our friends that come to visit our beautiful city.
 
Be prepared to a personalized check in, with our mostly enjoyed briefing on sightseeing, Oporto History and local tips!
 
So, enjoy our apartments!

Welcome to our self-catered apartments!
 
Located on the historical center of Oporto, in the heart of a UNESCO World Heritage Center, you'll find a building that belongs to our family for four generations.
 
After my mother (Lu'is grandmother) passed away in 2010 I inherited this building and found a really degraded space with a lot of structural problems and fierce tenants.
 
Having one apartment vacant me and my sons decided to refurbish the entire apartment and prepare it with all the needed amenities for a modern and cozy experience.
 
And we decided to rent it for tourists.
 
The first of our apartments came to daylight in May 2012. Our yellow apartment.
 
The experience was so overwhelming with massive bookings and great reviews that we decided to ""tackle"" the rest of the building.
 
And so we did.
 
In October 2012 the building went to major refurbishment works with all the structural, electricity, plumbing and communications being changed.
 
We repaired all the commons spaces, painted all the walls and ceilings, changed the windows, repaired and changed the floors, changed all the bathrooms and kitchens while maintaining at the same time all the qualities that give this building it’s finesse.
 
There wasn't a single square inch that we didn't touch!
  
The rest of the apartments came to the market in June 2013 and the bookings went sky high!
 
Right now we have 9 apartments: Blue (6 pax), Yellow (4 pax), Green (2 pax), Pink (2), Brown (2), Orange (2), White (2) , Grey (2) and Red (2)

Again all the critics are excellent with major emphasis on the quality of the apartments and the warm welcomes that both I and my son Luís provide.
 
This is a family business made with love and with respect for the guests that come here.
 
We want you to feel at home in a foreign place and we like to consider you as more than guests.
 
You are our friends that come to visit our beautiful city.
 
Be prepared to a personalized check in, with our mostly enjoyed briefing on sightseeing, Oporto History and local tips!
 
So, enjoy our apartments!

I've been an Airbnb host for 2 years now and I love it!

I've lived in Porto for most of my life and every day this city continues to amaze me. In the last couple of years Porto has been growing radically, specially when it comes to tourism, and it has been a pleasure to be part of it. Fortunately, this growth didn't affect the city's truly unique charm. It only turned it more dynamic!

I'm really passionate about traveling and I've already visited more than 30 countries (and counting). But when I am not traveling what I really enjoy is welcoming people from around the world. 

I really appreciate getting feedback from all guests. This will help me continue to improve my hosting skills.

Hope you enjoy Porto. See you soon!

That means we love our city and are very proud of it, perhaps especially its football team – the best in Portugal! It’s also evidence of how friendly and hospitable we are, and I’ll do my best to make your visit to Porto really enjoyable. Advice on where to go, the hidden gems that most tourists never get to see, the best places to eat, the best bargains and ways of getting around on a budget – just ask.

I used to live in this apartment, but when my daughter was born, 10 years ago, I moved around the corner. That means I’m readily available to help all I can – it’s what I do for a living, so you’re sure to get my undivided attention.

I may have lived in Porto all my life, but I’ve also travelled a fair bit, to the United States, to Asia and, of course, to other parts of Europe, so I understand what travellers need, and will always do my best to make your stay go smoothly.

The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privilege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

Oporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela vontade de quatro jovens amigos. A ORM nasce da combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. 

O projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.
Envolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. 
O nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. 
Assim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. 
Acrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.

Teresa grew up in Tras-os-Montes in the north of Portugal and I am originally from San Francisco in the U.S.   Our professional backgrounds are in the field of education. Teresa owned and operated her own Montessori pre-school in Porto for 20 years and I taught at the local Universidade  Catolica Portuguesa. We lived in Asia for 5 years where Teresa learned the art of Chinese brush painting. You will see her paintings and other Asian touches in the decoration of our apartment..  I love taking my bicycle for a ride along the river or down the coast, stopping to eat freshly grilled fish at a local restaurant. I also like playing golf on the local courses around the Porto area.  And a great habit I picked up in Asia is the art of tea drinking – I love the ceremony around tea and can’t go a day without my Puer or Oolongs.  Teresa loves to paint and read in her spare time and has studied color therapy. 
We enjoy hosting and meeting people from all over the world.  So come and share a glass of Port wine with us and spend some time in our fantastic city!

I love travelling around the world and I have lived in several places: Los Angeles, New York, Delft , Rotterdam, London, Montreal, among other short stays in many countries and cities. When I travel, I try to be a true local most of times, to get a grip of the dynamics of the place and the people that make that place.
I work in the fields of architecture and in theatre and the performing arts, devoting part of my time  to creative culinary arts. My five can't-live-without-things are: food, people, beauty, travel and art in-all-its-forms!

Sofia was born and raised in Porto and before a quick stop in France she moved to San Francisco. She visits frequently her hometown as all her family lives there and keeps up with all the new things to see or do there to the point their local friends ask her for suggestions!


Matthew was born and raised in Washington DC but he has been calling the Bay Area home for a while. He loves Porto and is always surprised by how much it changed the past couple of years.

Sofia worked for a while in business development for the Portuguese government in the west coast of the US  and during those years she got to know Portugal (top to bottom) even better. Should you need any tips she will happily help!

When we visit Porto we love to walk around get lost on the streets of the city. In every trip we get to see and do things we haven’t done before. We enjoy urban hikes, delicious food (you can find us either at a fancy restaurant or a hole in the wall) and just getting to know more about the people and the place we travel to.

Our daughters LOVE Porto. You will see that kids get a lot of attention (and an occasional treat) in Porto and that plus the wonderful summer weather, beaches, playgrounds and parks, etc make for a very fun stay!";within a few hours;100%;100%;t;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/a684d25c-93f4-40b3-b267-84109ffa3b7d.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/a684d25c-93f4-40b3-b267-84109ffa3b7d.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium;;1.0;1.0;['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id'];t;t;Porto, Portugal;Cedofeita, Ildefonso, Sé, Miragaia, Nicolau, Vitória;PORTO;41.14639;-8.61157;Entire condominium (condo);Entire home/apt;4;;2 baths;2.0;3.0;"[""Children\u2019s books and toys"", ""Single level home"", ""Hangers"", ""Oven"", ""Shampoo"", ""Iron"", ""Microwave"", ""Kitchen"", ""TV with standard cable"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Bed linens"", ""Lockbox"", ""Bathtub"", ""Wifi"", ""Essentials"", ""Cable TV"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""First aid kit"", ""Private entrance"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Children\u2019s dinnerware"", ""Hair dryer"", ""High chair"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Baby bath"", ""Stove"", ""Pack \u2019n play/Travel crib"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Hot water"", ""Free street parking"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Washer"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Private patio or balcony"", ""Dryer"", ""Heating"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Elevator"", ""Paid parking on premises"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Crib""]";$165.00;2;25;2;3;1125;1125;2.3;1125.0;;t;14;44;74;288;2021-12-09;141;7;2;2015-03-11;2021-11-29;4.96;4.99;4.99;4.91;4.96;4.99;4.89;50930/AL;f;1;1;0;0;1.72;

Coisas sem as quais não poderia passar: O ar que respiro (de preferência, no campo, onde é mais puro), a saúde, o sossego e a amizade incondicional da família e dos amigos.
Os destinos de viagem favoritos são, sem dúvida, locais por onde as civilizações egípcia, romana e árabe deixaram o seu rasto. Sem esquecer a África subsariana....
Os livros preferidos são os romances históricos e quanto  aos filmes, os de ficção científica e de desenho animado. Quanto à música, gosto de tanta que vai desde Bach e Chopin até AC/DC, passando por Sisters of Mercy, UB40, Sprinsteen, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Sinatra, Queen e tantos outros....

The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privilege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

-------

Oporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela vontade de quatro jovens amigos. A ORM nasce da combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. 

O projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.
Envolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. 
O nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. 
Assim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. 
Acrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.

I'm a portuguese pianist natural from Ponta Delgada (Azores)

During 30 months, I was living abroad in Berlin, Brussels and Barcelona, and then when I finished my musical studies I decided that in spite of being living in Lisbon for many years, Porto was the best place to get a place to live! 

It was here that I started university, where I got my best friends that became like a family, and maybe because I was born in the middle of the atlantic, maybe I need to have the sea so close...

Although is a small city, it's the best place to get life quality in Portugal (in my opinion).

I love host people from all over the world and let them know what can expect from Porto and their people.

I give importance to the small details, and that's what you can find at BBA Apartments, and I hope that you enjoy your stay as much I will to host you.";within an hour;100%;97%;t;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/29a5bd20-31fa-452e-82f8-bb45bfccab45.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/29a5bd20-31fa-452e-82f8-bb45bfccab45.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium;;3.0;3.0;['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual'];t;t;Porto, Boavista, Portugal;Cedofeita, Ildefonso, Sé, Miragaia, Nicolau, Vitória;PORTO;41.15522;-8.62619;Entire rental unit;Entire home/apt;2;;1 bath;1.0;1.0;"[""Washer \u2013\u00a0In unit"", ""Hangers"", ""HDTV with Chromecast, Netflix, standard cable"", ""Free parking garage on premises \u2013 1 space"", ""Oven"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Iron"", ""Microwave"", ""Kitchen"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Bathtub"", ""Bidet"", ""Wifi"", ""Dining table"", ""Essentials"", ""Cable TV"", ""Toaster"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Drying rack for clothing"", ""First aid kit"", ""Castelbel body soap"", ""Smart lock"", ""Cleaning before checkout"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Portable fans"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Safe"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Castelbel shampoo"", ""Stove"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Nespresso machine"", ""Hot water"", ""Baking sheet"", ""Free street parking"", ""Paid street parking off premises"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Private hot tub"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Piano"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Freezer"", ""Heating"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Elevator"", ""Shower gel"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Crib""]";$61.00;2;7;2;3;1125;1125;2.7;1125.0;;t;25;55;85;360;2021-12-09;147;19;3;2015-06-07;2021-12-07;4.71;4.81;4.79;4.79;4.84;4.59;4.65;120760/AL;f;3;3;0;0;1.85;

Metting new people is metting new countries. 

Oporto is my city and I love my city. The city of Oporto is very rich in history, monuments, wine and food.
I love the food from Oporto and Portugal. Tradicional food like ""tripas à moda do Porto"" or ""cozido à Portuguesa"" or ""bacalhau"" in every aways... And of course the great portugueses desserts.









Adoro ser feliz. Gosto de viajar mais e mais e mais.
Adoro arte. 
Adoro a minha cidade. A maravilhosa Cidade do Porto! 
A minha família e os meus amigos são as ""coisas"" mais importantes da minha vida, incluindo o meu Chico      (cão) e o meu Óscar (gato). 
Adoro dançar.
Adoro a comida portuguesa. As Tripas à moda do Porto, Cozido à portuguesa, Bacalhau de todas as maneiras... E as sobremesas.

The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privilege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

Oporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela vontade de quatro jovens amigos. A ORM nasce da combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. 

O projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.
Envolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. 
O nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. 
Assim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. 
Acrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.

We decided to rent our apartment because we think it has fantastic conditions for our guests and because we like people from other countries to enjoy our town. In fact we love traveling and discovering new cultures, we believe it help us understand better our world. Our family trip: 15 days in Brazil ...
The boys are passionate about motorsport and our children participate in races. Pedro is a Motorsport Engineer in a F3 team, and lives in Italy. Diogo wants to follow his brother and he is finishing his studies in mechanics too... As parents, we are their number 1 fans. We support them, no matter what!
In our spare time, we enjoy reading, listening to music, dance and walking the dogs.
We love the place we live in, because it is calm and when we arrive home after a long day at work  we can take a walk to the beach with our dogs. 
We now have a co-host, Diogo, who help us managing the bookings and the apartment.
Please enjoy our fantastic city and do not hesitate to ask for more details.

In fact we love traveling and discovering new cultures, we believe it help us understand better our world. Our family trip: 15 days in Brazil ...
The boys are passionate about motorsport and our children participate in races. Pedro is a Motorsport Engineer in a F3 team, and lives in Italy. Diogo wants to follow his brother and he is finishing his studies in mechanics too... As parents, we are their number 1 fans. We support them, no matter what!
In our spare time, we enjoy reading, listening to music, dance and walking the dogs.
We love the place we live in, because it is calm and when we arrive home after a long day at work  we can take a walk to the beach with our dogs.

We aim at greeting people like we would like to be greeted; in homes where we would like to live in; and show the places in our city where the real Porto culture still prevails.

We all love to travel, just like you. We are all born and raised in Porto. Even though, we travel constantly, for work or fun..., Porto is where home is! 

Our hosts across the world have made our journeys memorable - that hidden square, that restaurant with no english menus, unexpected block parties or that book left on the bedside table. Come visit us in Porto and we will return the favour! 

Most of the times, Filipe, Tiago & Sara will be your hosts, but whenever possible João, Nuno & Melo will come to meet you too!

Tenho 59 anos, falo inglês, francês e espanhol.
Gosto de viajar; Conhecer novas gentes e novos lugares.
Conheço quase todas as capitais europeias e,  de África, já estive em Marrocos e na ´Tunísia.
A Paris já fui 2 vezes mas é uma ciadade aonde apetece voltar mais vezes; Oh Paris, toujours Paris!! ;-))
Gosto de animais mas o meu preferido é o gato; Adoro a sua indepêndencia e auto confiança; Neste momento partilhamos a  casa com o  gato ""Félix"" que vive connosco há 13 anos.
Gosto do Verão e das suas noites quentes, de flores,  de chocolate, de praia, de passar um fim de semana no campo, de ler e cinema.
Em viagem sempre fiquei hospedada em hoteis mas, descobri a Airbnb através do meu filho que é um anfitrião aqui na cidade do Porto/Portugal e, como a oferta de apartamentos é tão boa, decidi experimentar; É a minha primeira vez ;-) Espero que corra bem!
Aos anfitrioes digo que os seus apartamentos ficam em boas mãos; Sou uma mulher muito organizada e cuidadosa; Se duvidar, consulte o meu horóscopo; Sou do signo Virgem, logo,  mais perfeccionista não há, LOL!!!

The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privilege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

-------

Oporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela vontade de quatro jovens amigos. A ORM nasce da combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. 

O projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.
Envolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. 
O nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. 
Assim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. 
Acrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.

The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privilege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

Oporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela vontade de quatro jovens amigos. A ORM nasce da combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. 

O projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.
Envolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. 
O nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. 
Assim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. 
Acrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.

It was the one in Boavista. 
The experience was great. The people who stayed loved the apartment, and I loved the concept of renting my flat to visitors. I prepared the flat not only with furniture and bed linen! I tried to gather useful information about Porto and surroundings in order to help my guests make the best of their time in town.
Then friends and family, who either got married and saw their families grow or had to move abroad, started asking me to take care of their flats, apartments or townhouses and find guests. Again, I prepared the flats so that anyone visiting Porto would feel welcome and easily integrated in Porto.
Well, now it's two of us, me and my colleague Paula (https://www.airbnb.pt/users/show/180050) and we decided to create a small company called Flat in Porto to manage all these flats and get them ready to welcome you in our city.

Tenho 59 anos, falo inglês, francês e espanhol.
Gosto de viajar; Conhecer novas gentes e novos lugares.
Conheço quase todas as capitais europeias e,  de África, já estive em Marrocos e na ´Tunísia.
A Paris já fui 2 vezes mas é uma ciadade aonde apetece voltar mais vezes; Oh Paris, toujours Paris!! ;-))
Gosto de animais mas o meu preferido é o gato; Adoro a sua indepêndencia e auto confiança; Neste momento partilhamos a  casa com o  gato ""Félix"" que vive connosco há 13 anos.
Gosto do Verão e das suas noites quentes, de flores,  de chocolate, de praia, de passar um fim de semana no campo, de ler e cinema.
Em viagem sempre fiquei hospedada em hoteis mas, descobri a Airbnb através do meu filho que é um anfitrião aqui na cidade do Porto/Portugal e, como a oferta de apartamentos é tão boa, decidi experimentar; É a minha primeira vez ;-) Espero que corra bem!
Aos anfitrioes digo que os seus apartamentos ficam em boas mãos; Sou uma mulher muito organizada e cuidadosa; Se duvidar, consulte o meu horóscopo; Sou do signo Virgem, logo,  mais perfeccionista não há, LOL!!!

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team.

O projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.
Envolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes.

It was the one in Boavista. 
The experience was great. The people who stayed loved the apartment, and I loved the concept of renting my flat to visitors. I prepared the flat not only with furniture and bed linen! I tried to gather useful information about Porto and surroundings in order to help my guests make the best of their time in town.
Then friends and family, who either got married and saw their families grow or had to move abroad, started asking me to take care of their flats, apartments or townhouses and find guests. Again, I prepared the flats so that anyone visiting Porto would feel welcome and easily integrated in Porto.
Well, now it's two of us, me and my colleague Paula (https://www.airbnb.pt/users/show/180050) and we decided to create a small company called Flat in Porto to manage all these flats and get them ready to welcome you in our city.
